# Hexagonal-Test

Right now this is a proof of concept.  I'm trying to create a Hexagonal Grid (Flat Top) and allow the user to interact with a cell on the grid with the mouse.

Later - My own personal Grid Mapping Program 

Even Later - Some sort of strategic war game?  I guess that's possible...

## Currently:
- Display a grid
- Capture mouse entering and leaving the grid canvas
- Track the mouse movement on the canvas
- Display current mouse position when the mouse is on the grid canvas.

## ToDo:
- Grid needs to be stored as an array (or linked list?)
- Translate mouse coordinates to Grid Coordinates
- Highlight the grid cell that the mouse is over
- Do something to grid cell (Probably just change the color to begin with)
